SRC2 final JPG files
Non-stimuli image files needed for experiment running

This folder contains the supporting image files for SRC2 
these are all the JPGs needed to run the experiment that 
are not stimuli (either reference categories or targets). 
These include the task instruction images (prac.jpg and 
test.jpg) and the practice trial feedback images 
(pracFeedback_.jpg files). Additionally there is a JPG 
(end.jpg) which is an exit screen.
